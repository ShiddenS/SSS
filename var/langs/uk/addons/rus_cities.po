In this upgrade we've added regions for CIS countries. To make SDEK work with these regions properly, please complete the following steps:<ul><li>Open the directory with your store on the server.

Here's how to determine which files you need to restore:<ul><li>You have to restore cities_new_list.sql. This file is used by the \"Cities\" add-on, which is required for many shipping methods.</li><li>If you had SDEK, eDost, PECOM, or Delovye Linii add-ons installed before the upgrade, restore the corresponding SQL files.</li></ul></li></ul>After that, SDEK and other real-time shipping methods will work with the CIS regions properly. The steps above are necessary to preserve any data (such as shipping methods, cities, etc.) that you may have created in the past.
